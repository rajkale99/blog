      <description>Kernel Guidelines: The following aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to be added into kernel sources:
 OC/UC/UV, not mattering whether it&amp;rsquo;s for display, GPU or CPU. Any changes regarding charging voltages. Magisk/App Blocker without the need to block toxic modules like FDE.AI. Blocking TikTok/any similar app isn&amp;rsquo;t allowed either. Boeffla Wakelock Blocker. Wakelocks exists for a reason. The removal of those that are harmful for the device isnt allowed. Scheduler restrictions don&amp;rsquo;t apply. However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we don&amp;rsquo;t look/care about all the possible crappy schedulers you pushed.</description>

      <description>To become a maintainer of LegionOS: Before you apply to add your device into our list of official devices, you should know a few things:
Any failure in following the instructions given below will make you unfit for the maintainership. No questions asked.
1 - You must own the device. Blind and untested builds aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed. Devices that have minimal hardware difference from yours are allowed to be maintained, as long as you maintain your own device too.</description>
